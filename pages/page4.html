    <h1><u>What does Mobile developer do?</u></h1>
    <big>
        This is a developer who writes code for applications that run natively on consumer mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Mobile development was almost unheard of before the early 2000s and the explosion of the smartphone market. Before then mobile development was considered a subset of embedded development.
        <br><br>
        <strong><u>Generally</u></strong> speaking, <b>mobile app developers</b> can build an app in one of these three categories: Native apps — Coded in a language that’s supported natively by a specific device’s operating system. (Example: native iOS app vs. native Android app). Hybrid apps — Cross-platform development.
