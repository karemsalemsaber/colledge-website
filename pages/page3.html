    <h1><u>What does a CRM developer do?</u></h1>
        <big>
            <b>A CRM developer</b> is a software developer who specializes in implementing enhancements for a CRM system based on any business’ requirements. Any business’ CRM requirements are not always met by the CRM systems that exist in the market.
            <br><br>
            <b>CRM</b>—or customer relationship management —is business software that helps individuals and teams maximize their customer communications and sales efforts. CRM isn’t simply an address book. It empowers your team to build relationships more effectively and provide the best customer experience from evaluation to purchase and beyond.
